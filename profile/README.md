## About

Tarti is an NFT application and a generative AI system that allows you to give birth to unique intelligent entities that live on the blockchain and make art.
Each entity is an NFT and each piece of art that it creates is also an NFT (On the TARTIST and TARTI contracts, respectively.)

For now the art they make is always original professional music compositions. But the Tarti bots' divierse skillset will be exposed more over time.

Tarti is made up of:

- Two Ethereum smart contracts: [Tartist.sol](https://github.com/TartiNft/tarti/blob/dev/contracts/Tartist.sol) and [Tarti.sol](https://github.com/TartiNft/tarti/blob/dev/contracts/Tarti.sol).
- An [event listener](https://github.com/TartiNft/tarti-workers), service bus queue, and [service worker](https://github.com/TartiNft/tarti-workers)
- A Dapp call [Tartiweb](https://github.com/TartiNft/tartiweb)
- An off-chain generative AI system called [TRAIT AI](https://github.com/TartiNft/beatmaker)
- An HTTP interface to the TRAIT AI Engine called [TraitHttpIO](https://github.com/TartiNft/trait-http)

What does it do?

- TRAIT AI Bots can do anything. They're kinda like people. Right now they're good at making music, but they can do other stuff too.
- Tarti provides an interface to TRAIT AI via Ethereum ERC721 Smart Contracts.
- Tarti provides proof of ownership, chain pf custody, royalty payouts, and right ownership selling and trading via the smart contracts.

### Demos

[Initial Raw Demo - Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nlXNjfCda84)

### Tartist
Simply put, a Tartist is a bot. Presently, Tartists are all music producers.
A Tartist is also an NFT.
It is unique as an NFT in that it can create other NFTs.
The NFTs that Tartists create are called Tartis.

### Tarti
A Tarti is an NFT. As of now, Tartis are all music and related files.

### Off-chain Interactions
When a Tartist or Tarti is minted, an off chain service will create the related multimedia and store it on IPFS at tarti.eth, which will be linked by the NFTs metadata.

### Dapp
A Dapp to interact with these contracts can be found at [Github](http://github.com/TartiNft/tartiweb)

### System Diagram
!["High level diagram of the Tarti system"](tarti-high-diagram.svg "System Diagram")

### Token rights
The copyrights for the art generated by a Tartist are automatically owned by whomever holds the Tartist token for that Tartist at the time the art is generated.
To designate ownership of a particular Tartist, a Tartist token can be held by an account on the Ethereum blockchain. The Tartist token is a fully compliant ERC721 Non Funglible Token (NFT).

When a Tartist generates art, they mint a Tarti token on the blockchain. This Tarti token lives in the Tarti smart contract and is automatically transferred to the owner of the Tartist token for the Tartist who generated the art. Therefor, the owner of a Tartist token will automatically inherit ownership of any Tarti tokens generated by the Tartist. When a Tartist token is sold/transferred, copyrights to any future pieces of art will belong to the new holder of the Tartist token.

Tartsists and Tartis can be transferred and/or sold on public marketplaces such as OpenSea.io like any other NFT.
Tartis can be transferred independent of Tartists.

### Built With

- Solidity
- OpenZepplin
- Truffle

## Usage

### Tartist

The Tartist contract expsoses these functions (in addition to standard ERC721 functions)
- `mintTo(address recipient)`
- `newArt(uint8 artistId)`

### Tarti

The Tarti contract expsoses these functions (in addition to standard ERC721 functions)
- `artByArtist(uint8 artistId, uint256 artOrdinal)`
